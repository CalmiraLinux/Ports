The Libksba package contains a library used to make X.509 certificates as well as making the CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax) easily accessible by other applications. Both specifications are building blocks of S/MIME and TLS. The library does not rely on another cryptographic library but provides hooks for easy integration with Libgcrypt.
