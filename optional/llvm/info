 The LLVM package contains a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. The Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) Core libraries provide a modern source and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!). These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation ("LLVM IR").

Clang provides new C, C++, Objective C and Objective C++ front-ends for LLVM and is required by some desktop packages such as firefox and for rust if that is built using the system LLVM.
