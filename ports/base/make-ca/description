Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a method to validate the authenticity of an
otherwise unknown entity across untrusted networks. PKI works by establishing a
chain of trust, rather than trusting each individual host or entity explicitly.
In order for a certificate presented by a remote entity to be trusted, that
certificate must present a complete chain of certificates that can be validated
using the root certificate of a Certificate Authority (CA) that is trusted by
the local machine.

Establishing trust with a CA involves validating things like company address,
ownership, contact information, etc., and ensuring that the CA has followed
best practices, such as undergoing periodic security audits by independent
investigators and maintaining an always available certificate revocation list.
